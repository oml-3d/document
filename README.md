# OML - Object Markup Language

OML(the Object Markup Language) is core technology for building AR contents.
OML provides structures, designs and functionalities of the AR content within single OML file.
Along with [components](https://github.com/oml-3d/document/components.md), [graphics](https://github.com/oml-3d/document/graphics.md), and [scripting](https://github.com/oml-3d/document/scripting.md) are the basis of building AR contents for Spacial Web.
With OML, authors describe the structure of AR content using _markup_.
